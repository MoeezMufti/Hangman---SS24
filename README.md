# Hangman: Untangling Themes & Quests ---SS24
This project proposes a hangman game which follows the traditional hangman rules but adds some new twists. 

## Features
•	There are a total of six tries. It has a thematic twist where there will be two levels: First & Second. 

•	First Level will be decoding the theme of arts which is either literature or movies based on the hint given. 

•	Second Level will be finding the specific word related to it like an author's work or a director’s popular film. The hints for each of the two will also be given.

•	In the second level, for every streak of three, there will be extra life given by deducting one number from the number of misses. 

•	At the end of the game, you will get an option to either restart or close the game.
